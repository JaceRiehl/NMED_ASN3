# Face Drawer
This project uses P5 and clmtrackr to allow a user to draw with their face from their webcam. P5.js creates a web processing environment that can be interacted with, such as drawing on the canvas. While clmtrackr provides facial data directly from the userâ€™s webcam. Combined, these two create the ability to draw on the P5 canvas using the data used from clmtrackr.
The goal of this project is to provide as much flexibility to the user as possible with the limitations of using their face. It gives the user a variety of options to draw on the canvas. The user can show or hide their webcam to give an idea of how their face is interacting with the website. It also includes a variety of shapes and sizes to add more flexibility. Of course, the user can also turn the drawing function on and off. 
To get started you can clone the repository or visit the GitHub page in order start drawing.
The inspiration for this project came from P5 itself. P5 allows provides a layer of ablactation that allows users to interact with it in a way that inspires their creativity. So by adding as many drawing options possible it provides creativity back to the user.
